// mmr = 5% → stored as num = 5, den = 100
// mmr = 2.5% → num = 25, den = 1000

//This is used so you can represent decimal percentages without floats.

// Why use rational (num/den) instead of float?
// Because:
// Floating point math is not deterministic across different systems
// On-chain programs must avoid floats entirely
// Using Ratio (num/den) ensures exact math with no rounding surprises
